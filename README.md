## Naive Bayes Email Spam Classification

Overview

This repository contains Python code for a Naive Bayes classifier designed to predict whether an email is spam or not spam. The classifier is trained on a dataset of emails. The dataset includes both ham (non-spam) and spam emails.

The code uses the CountVectorizer from scikit-learn for feature extraction and the MultinomialNB (Multinomial Naive Bayes) classifier for training. The performance of the classifier is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

This codes can process the emails, train the Naive Bayes classifier, and evaluate its performance.

The main Python script containing the Naive Bayes classifier code.

spam/: Directory to store spam emails.


## Part-of-Speech (POS)

Overview

Part-of-Speech Tagging is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves assigning grammatical categories (such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) to words in a sentence. There are two main approaches to POS tagging: Rule-Based and Statistical-Based methods.

Rule-Based POS Tagging:

Approach: 
Rule-based POS tagging relies on hand-crafted rules to assign POS tags to words in a sentence.

Characteristics:
Rules are typically created by linguists or language experts based on linguistic principles and patterns observed in language.
Rules are applied sequentially to words in the sentence, and the first matching rule assigns the corresponding POS tag to the word.

Advantages:
Transparent and interpretable: Rules can be easily understood and modified by linguists or NLP practitioners.
Can handle specific linguistic patterns effectively.

Disadvantages:
Limited coverage: Rule-based systems may struggle with handling ambiguous words or complex linguistic phenomena.
Labor-intensive: Crafting and maintaining rules for all linguistic patterns can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

Statistical-Based POS Tagging:

Approach: 
Statistical-based POS tagging employs machine learning algorithms to automatically learn patterns and associations between words and their POS tags from annotated corpora.

Characteristics:
Uses labeled training data (annotated corpora) to train a statistical model that predicts the POS tags of unseen words based on context.
Commonly employs algorithms such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs), or Conditional Random Fields (CRFs).

Advantages:
Data-driven: Learns patterns and associations directly from annotated data, enabling adaptation to various linguistic contexts and languages.
Can handle ambiguity and context-dependent tagging more effectively than rule-based systems.

Disadvantages:
Black-box nature: Statistical models may lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand why certain tags are assigned to words.
Requires annotated training data: Training accurate statistical models relies on the availability of large, high-quality annotated corpora, which may not always be available for all languages or domains.
